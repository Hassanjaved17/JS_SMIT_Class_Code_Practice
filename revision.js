// variables in js the difference between var, let and const are that var is function scoped and can be re-declared and updated, let is block scoped and can be updated but not re-declared, const is block scoped and cannot be updated or re-declared. 
// var is used to declare a variable that can be re-declared and updated, let is used to declare a variable that can be updated but not re-declared, const is used to declare a variable that cannot be updated or re-declared.

// var a = 10;
// var b = 20;
// var c = a + b;
// console.log(c);

// let x = 10;
// x = 20;
// console.log(x); 

var bolean = true;
var a = 10;
var c = a + bolean;
console.log(c); // 11 because true is treated as 1 in arithmetic operations.
